# IPRO - Iterated Pareto Referent Optimisation
Iterated Pareto Referent Optimisation (IPRO) is an algorithm that decomposes learning the Pareto front into a sequence of single-objective problems, each of which is solved by an oracle and leads to a non-dominated solution. IPRO is guaranteed to converge and comes with an upper bound on the distance to the Pareto front at each iteration.
